##Data Serialization & Test Vectors - A JSON-Based Approach
-Project Overview
  This repository provides a detailed solution for testing the serialization and deserialization of various data types using JSON. The project demonstrates how to structure and test different data patterns through JSON, showcasing a variety of use cases ranging from simple values to complex, nested data structures. The test vectors provided in this project are designed to help ensure the integrity and reliability of serialization and deserialization implementations.

-Project Details
  The core focus of this project is to handle data serialization in JSON format, utilizing various types of inputs and structures for testing purposes. The collection of test vectors includes inputs such as basic primitive types, nested objects, large integers, mixed data types in lists, and simple nested dictionaries. These vectors serve as both examples and validation tools for handling data correctly in real-world scenarios.

Here are the key test vectors included in this project:

-Basic Data Types: A basic example using null, arrays, and integers.
Complex Nested Structures: A scenario with nested dictionaries and lists.
Large Integer Handling: A test case designed to check the handling of large integer values.
Mixed Lists: This test case evaluates arrays containing multiple data types.
Simple Nested Dictionary: A straightforward dictionary with nested data elements.

-Main Features
Test Vector 1: Basic Types
This test case explores simple types like null, byte arrays, and integers.

Test Vector 2: Nested Structures
A more intricate case that includes arrays within dictionaries and other objects.

Test Vector 3: Handling Large Numbers
This vector is dedicated to testing how large integer values are serialized and deserialized.

Test Vector 4: Mixed-Type List
Tests the handling of lists containing diverse types such as integers and strings.

Test Vector 5: Simple Nested Dictionary
A basic nested dictionary example that helps test simple key-value pairs.


Name: A brief description of the test case.
Input: The JSON data that serves as the input for the test.
Expected Output: The anticipated result after serialization/deserialization, which serves as a comparison during testing.


-How to Use
  To utilize this project for validation and testing, follow these steps:

Load JSON: Deserialize the test_vectors.json file into your program. And run the fie test_runner.py.
Execute Tests: Use the data from the input section of each test vector to perform serialization or deserialization.
Check Output: After performing the serialization/deserialization operation, compare the resulting data with the expected output.

-Sample Test Vector Format
json
Copy code
{
      "name": "Test Vector 1",
      "input": [
        1,
        "apple",
        3,
        "banana"
      ]
    }
